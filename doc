        given this dataset if images:
        read each image and say this is a one this is a seven etc.
        to get some train data to feed the neural network

        neural network of n neurons 
        cost function 
        train function
        -> learn function
        log function
    */
    
    /* APPROACH
        this neural network has two layers
        input layer has 784 nodes which is pixels of each image 
        has no parameters
        first layer has 10 nodes (hidden layer) 
        second layer 10 nodes (output layer)
        (both layers are a linear combination of the input layer)
    */


    /* FORWARD PROPAGATION
        compute what the output will be for the input
        
        1. input layer A0 = x (784 x m) 
        
        2. Z1 = W1 x A0 + b1  (linear algebra, weight and bias)
          10xm, 10x784, 784xm,10x1 => 10xm
    
        3. Activation Function: (necessary otherwise we would just have a fancy linear combination)
        tan / sigmoid which makes it non linear which is necessary to describe this complicated stuff mathmatically
        RELU - rectified linear unit = x if x > 0 and 0 of x <=0

        => A1 = g(Z1) = ReLU(Z1)

        4. Z2 = W2 x A1 + b2 (second layer)

        A2 = softmax(Z2) - output layer -> softwamax() -> probablilities
        softmax := e^zi / sum e^zj (maps values between 0-1)
    */

    /* BACKWARDS PROPAGATION
        -> given random weights and biases for the model and some training data,
        run this through the model, see the output vs the expected output and 
        change it around until it works

        -> approximate it using math cost function, learn function etc.
        the training data can just be 1 for 3 and 0 for all else if the picture
        shows a three

        -> use derivatives of weight and bias functions to learn
        then update the weights and biases accordingly

reading the data from the IDX File:

Stores images in binary as 1D bin strings:
    Header (first few bytes):
        Magic number: identifies type and dimensions
        Number of images
        Image height
        Image width
    Data (rest of the file):
        Every pixel is a byte (0–255)
        Images are “flattened” into 1D arrays
        Stored sequentially, so first 28×28 bytes = first image, next 28×28 bytes = second image, etc.
